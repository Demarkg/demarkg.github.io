        <p>Are you someone that is looking for a meaningful opportunity to get involved and support our local schools? If so, now is the time to join the parent-teacher organization (PTO). The PTO brings parents and teachers together to improve communication, plan events, and ultimately build a sense of community at our schools. A school district where parents and teachers work together is exactly what our kids need and deserve. However, many of our school's PTOs need new members to bolster their ranks and prepare the next generation of parent leaders. Please consider contacting your child's school to inquire about supporting or joining the PTO. </p>
