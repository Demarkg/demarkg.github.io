            <h1 class="article-title">Referendum 2023</h1>
            <p>What time is it in Oconomowoc? Well, of course, it's referendum time again. The school district has been working double-time to promote $75,450,000 in new spending. You can hardly turn the corner lately without bumping into some sort of promotional material designed to sway your vote in favor of the referendum. How does a new HVAC system and roof sound to you? If you like that, you may also be interested in a renovated art room and an expanded cafeteria. Don't worry about anything; you can have all this and more while your mill rate remains very low and manageable. Just a cup of coffee in the bizarro world of BIG government. If you dare question any of this, you risk being labeled an "enemy of education" or even "anti-children." </p>

            <h1 class="article-title">Join The PTO</h1>
            <p>Are you someone that is looking for a meaningful opportunity to get involved and support our local schools? If so, now is the time to join the parent-teacher organization (PTO). The PTO brings parents and teachers together to improve communication, plan events, and ultimately build a sense of community at our schools. A school district where parents and teachers work together is exactly what our kids need and deserve. However, many of our school's PTOs need new members to bolster their ranks and prepare the next generation of parent leaders. Please consider contacting your child's school to inquire about supporting or joining the PTO.</p>

            <h1 class="article-title">Conservative Daniel Kelly</h1>
            <p>Justice Daniel Kelly will preserve constitutional rights, uphold the rule of law, and prevent judicial activism. He’s an experienced and trustworthy judicial conservative who will apply the law as it is written, rather than legislate from the bench. His opponent, Janet Protasiewicz, is a liberal activist who seeks to put her thumb on the scale by ruling based on her political beliefs, rather than the rule of law. </p>
          <p>Justice Daniel Kelly is a judicial constitutionalist who has dedicated a lifetime to the law. He served on the Wisconsin Supreme Court from 2016 to 2020, a tenure marked by his rigorous scholarship, judicial humility, and an unwavering commitment to the rule of law. The scores of opinions authored by Justice Kelly during his service on the Supreme Court stand as witnesses to his commitment to our constitution and the rule of law.</p>
