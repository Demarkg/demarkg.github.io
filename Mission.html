            <h2>Vision / Reflection</h2>
            <p>
Ready or not, a new year has arrived. The onset of a new year is an excellent time for reflection, resolution, and optimism that better times lie ahead. Recently, the leadership team for our group has been reflecting upon our experiences working with the great people of Oconomowoc. Our collective efforts have made a distinct and positive impact over the last few years. The transformation of our school board is a prime example of the difference a community can make when they are constructively engaged. We seemingly face new challenges daily, and we have every reason to be optimistic that our community will meet them successfully.
We have had our share of struggles, disagreements, and missteps along our journey. Some of that is to be expected as we often address sensitive political topics that impact us personally. In the future, we will focus on growing and improving in several areas.
We will work to improve the quality and tone of the discourse in our group. This is a challenging task for sure. Yes, we encourage spirited debate over false compliance to popular opinions. After all, we are a group of conservative thinkers, which implies that we are also fiercely independent thinkers who make our own decisions. That said, we recognize constructive and respectful discussions are essential for our group to reach its full potential. Ultimately, we must find balance and keep minor differences from eclipsing the vast opportunities we have to build on common ground.
We value and appreciate those that have stepped forward to represent us. They deserve our respect and support, but we must also be able to hold them accountable. Our approach can be summarized this way. We will not be attack dogs, nor will we be lap dogs; we will be watchdogs. This means we will call things as we see them and manage our relationships with elected officials to maintain a professional and objective perspective.
We will work to build solutions together. There is a time to express dissatisfaction and hold others to account. However, there must also be a time to hold ourselves to account for our contribution to the solution. This will not be easy; solutions that satisfy us all are hard to come by. We can build those solutions together by staying engaged, applying conservative principles, and challenging the status quo with innovative new ideas.</p>
